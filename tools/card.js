/**
 * How wide each kind of photo is actually drawn, read off styles.css so the
 * browser can pick a copy rather than fetching a 4000px original for a 250px
 * hole. 768px is the phone breakpoint used throughout the stylesheet.
 *
 *   carousel — .lp-car-face is 3/4 of the carousel's 31.25rem height (20rem on
 *              a phone), so 375px and 240px
 *   category — .lp-getyours is 4 columns of the 1180px container, less .lp-gy's
 *              padding and border; 2 columns on a phone
 *   product  — .lp-grid is 2 columns of 900px; 2 columns of the viewport on a
 *              phone
 *   studio   — .lp-ceo gives the photo 0.5 of a 0.5fr/1.5fr split, capped at
 *              230px on a phone
 *   gallery  — .lp-detail is auto-fit minmax(300px,1fr) with a 40px gap, so it
 *              is two columns until the container drops under 640px — around a
 *              712px viewport, hence the 720px breakpoint rather than the usual
 *              768. Above it the column is half the container less the gap:
 *              ~44vw while the container is still tracking the viewport, then a
 *              flat 570px once the container caps at 1180px (viewport 1308px,
 *              where the clamped page gutter has reached its own 64px cap).
 *
 *              Those are the layout widths; the numbers below are 1.5x them,
 *              and that multiplier is why the gallery stopped looking soft.
 *              `sizes` is what the browser multiplies by the screen density to
 *              choose a copy, so the honest 570px picked the 1200 on a 2x
 *              laptop and never reached the 1600 the detail profile offers.
 *              1.5x also covers the crop: .lp-gallery img is object-fit:cover
 *              in a 3/4 frame, so a landscape upload is scaled until its height
 *              fills the frame and its width overflows — up to 1.78x the column
 *              for a 4:3 photo, all of which comes out of the same pixels.
 *              Cards do not get this: nobody studies a thumbnail, and there the
 *              multiplier would be pure waste.
 *
 * These are hints, not promises: get one wrong and the browser fetches a copy
 * a size out, which is still far less than the original.
