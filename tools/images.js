/**
 * Where image-host knowledge lives.
 *
 * Photos reach the CMS as whole URLs — picked out of the ImageKit library or
 * pasted in by hand — so the site never controls their pixel size: an editor
 * uploading straight off a phone camera hands every visitor a 4000px original
 * for a card drawn 436px wide. Hosts that resize on delivery can be asked for
 * a smaller copy just by rewriting the address, and this file holds the one
 * table of how to ask, per host.
 *
 * A host that is not in the table gets its address back untouched. That is the
 * whole fallback: an unrecognised photo is served exactly as it is today, so
 * adding a host is additive and forgetting one costs bytes, never a broken
 * picture.

/**
 * How hard to ask a host to work, per kind of photo. Two profiles, because the
 * two kinds of photo on this site are looked at differently.
 *
 *   card   — a thumbnail in a grid, glanced at on the way to somewhere else.
 *            The largest is drawn around 436px, so 800 covers it on a 2× screen
 *            and 1200 covers the same card on a 3× phone. Compression is left
 *            to the host's own judgement, which is tuned to be invisible at a
 *            glance and is where most of the byte saving comes from.
 *
 *   detail — the gallery on a product page. This is the photo a customer
 *            decides on, zooms their face towards, and compares against what
 *            arrives, so it is worth spending bytes on: a fixed high quality
 *            rather than the host's judgement, and a 1600 step above the card
 *            widths.
 *
 * 1600 is deliberately the largest step, and that is what bounds the cost: no
 * device can ask for anything above it however dense its screen, so the biggest
 * download a product page can produce is one 1600-wide copy at this quality —
 * the ~300-500 KB the owner budgeted for. Raising the ceiling means raising
 * that bill, so add a step here only with a number in mind.
