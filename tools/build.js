 * clone stamps every file with the moment it was checked out — so mtimes would
 * date every page "today" on every deploy. A sitemap that claims the whole
 * site changed each time is worse than one with no dates at all: it is the
 * signal search engines learn to ignore.
 *
 * So the dates come from git, in one call for the whole directory. A shallow
 * clone cannot answer the question — it holds one commit, and would date
 * everything to that — so it returns nothing and every URL goes out without a
 * <lastmod>, which is valid and honest. If the deployed sitemap has no dates,
 * that is what happened: give the build a full clone.
