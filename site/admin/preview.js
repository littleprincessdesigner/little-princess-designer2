/**
 * The live preview panel for products.
 *
 * The right-hand third of the product editor used to be empty: `editor.preview`
 * was off, so the only way to see how a piece looked was to publish it and open
 * the site. This draws the real shop card instead, updating as the form is
 * typed into.
 *
 * "The real card" is meant literally. The markup comes from `productCard()` in
 * tools/card.js — the same function, in the same file, that the build uses to
 * write every card on the live site, delivered here by the build's copy step
 * (tools/build.js). There is no second copy of the card to keep in step, which
 * is the whole reason that file was pulled out of tools/render.js.
 *
 * Three things this file has to bridge:
 *
 *   1. Decap hands over the form as it stands this keystroke — half-typed, with
 *      no name or sizes on a new piece. `fromCmsEntry()` in tools/card.js turns
 *      that into something drawable and reports what is missing.
 *   2. The preview is an iframe of its own, so the site's stylesheets have to
 *      be registered with it explicitly or the card renders unstyled.
 *   3. The readable subcategory name ("g3" → "Casual dresses") is not in the
 *      form, which holds only the code. It is read from /data/products.json,
 *      which the build already writes.
 *
 * Loaded after decap-cms.js — see the note beside the script tags in
 * index.html. Everything here is defensive: this panel is a convenience, and
 * nothing it can fail at should be able to stop the admin loading.

      // "preview only" button to widen this panel to the full editor width,

      // real two-column desktop one. Leaving it out means .lp-detail's own

      // squares the gallery photo on a real desktop visit, and widens it to
      // 4:3 only past its own phone breakpoint (max-width:768px) — a rule
      // written for an actual phone, not for this panel being narrow because
      // it is squeezed into half a desktop screen. Left alone, a normal split
      // pane is usually under that width, so the preview would show the wide
      // phone crop while the owner's own desktop visit to the real page shows
      // the square one — the exact photo looking a different shape in each
      // place. Pinning it to square here, at higher specificity than either
      // of styles.css's own rules so it wins regardless of which one the
      // panel's width would otherwise trigger, keeps it matching the desktop
